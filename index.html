         <h2>Colombia</h2>
         <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">
            In the United States, people are often afraid of Colombia. <em>&quotIsn't that dangerous?&quot</em> is a question we got a lot before and after we went.  Colombia is actually very safe and very nice.  The people are lovely, the cities are organized and beautiful.  Bogota&#769 is especially amazing.  We hope to return to Bogota&#769 soon, and we even think of purchasing a condo there someday.

         <h2>The Galapagos</h2>
         <p>Everything they say about this place is true. I've never seen so much wildlife in one place. It is the best place to feel at one with nature and witness some incredible animals in their own habitat. Giant tortoises, iguanas, sea lions, and so much more.</p>

         <h2>Cambodia</h2>
         <p>We went here to see Angkor Watt which is truly spectacular. Wondering around these ancient ruins and looking up close at the intricate designs is amazing. The Cambodian people are also extremely welcoming and friendly. I wish we had stayed longer.</p>

         <h2>Japan</h2>
         <p>There are a lot of amazing things to see in Japan. It should be on everyone's bucket list. One of our favorite parts of the trip ended up being a digital art museum in Tokyo (teamLab Borderless). It was a giant building with tons of rooms, some even hidden, where the art moved around the walls and yu could interact with it as it passed over the floor. It was truly like nothing else I;ve seen before or since.</p>

         <h2>Egypt</h2>
         <p>Egypt is a bit rough on its tourists. We faced a lot of harrassment throughout our trip. But, it was great to see some important pieces of history (even though they were unfortunately very poorly protected). We also got scuba certified in the Red Sea, which was gorgeous.</p>
